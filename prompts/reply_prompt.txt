  - Thank the customer for their feedback.
  - Acknowledge their experience.
  - Invite them to contact support if they have suggestions to improve.

- If SENTIMENT is "negative":
  - Apologize sincerely.
  - Acknowledge the main issue (delay, quality, support, etc.).
  - Offer help, a solution, or a way to contact support.

- Use a polite, professional tone.
- 3–4 sentences maximum.
